    <P>With over a year of experience as a private 
        tutor and teacher, I have honed my skills 
        in effectively communicating and conveying 
        information to a wide range of students. 
        My passion for the computer and editing 
        industry led me to take a job as a 
        graphic designer at a printing press, where I further developed my design skills. 
        I took advantage of various online platforms such as Udemy and Skillcrush to learn computer skills and 
        worked as an assistant in web development. I am also experienced in writing, including academic and 
        freelance writing. I have started my own computer skills-based start-up business related to 
        printing, where I am the chief executive. My experience in leading team projects and being a team leader 
        has allowed me to effectively manage and coordinate with a team. Currently, I am running my business 
        virtually and teaching computer skills at Universal Computer Coaching Academy Kotmomin and some 
        online institutes. I have also created my own notes for students on various computer languages. 
        My portfolio includes a variety of projects in web development. Overall, I am a dedicated and versatile 
        professional with a wide 
        range of skills and experience in the computer and editing industry.</P>
